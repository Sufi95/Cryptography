# Cryptography
In this assignment you have to study the performance (in terms of runtime) of DES, RSA and SHA-512.

You can use any programming languages, any built-in libraries
Create three files of 100, 500 and 1000 MBs. 
Apply DES (both encryption and decryption), RSA (both encryption and decryption) and SHA-512 (generate hash).
Measure the time required (in second, milisecond or microsecond which one is applicable).
Submissions:
Submit a report. Your report should mention the exact size of the file, data type of the file, runtime for each algorithm, necessary keys and other inititalization parameters (if necessary) and the generated hash values in SHA-512.
Submit all the codes.
Upload everything in a single PDF file.
